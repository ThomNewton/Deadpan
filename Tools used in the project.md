We used Google Gemini (https://gemini.google.com) to help with the following:
- generating ERD of our database,
- commenting code
- generating information about films in the seed
- beautifying user manual and README

We used Mermaid Live Editor (https://mermaid.live/) to vizualize the ERD model.

We used Doxygen (https://doxygen.nl/) to generate the final documentation.

We used a poster picture from "Coffee and Cigarettes" (2003) directed by Jim Jarmusch, from Gutek Film website (https://gutekfilm.pl/kawa-i-papierosy-jarmusch) 

We used favicon.io (https://favicon.io/) to generate icon and logo from the aforementioned photo.

We used TMDB (https://www.themoviedb.org/) API to access information about the films present in the database.

We used Google Fonts (https://fonts.google.com/) to change the font of the project to variations of Crimson Text.
